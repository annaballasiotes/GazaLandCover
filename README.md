# Gaza Land Cover: Occupation as a Land Use

This project will expand upon the GEOG 699 course from last spring, “Occupation as a Land Use,” and the work done to study landscape changes in Gaza from 2000 to 2015. I will focus on the three main military operations imparted by Israel, as well as effects of the blockade -- a border buffer, abandoned Israeli settlements, and other forms of occupation. Because much of this work is done in Google Earth Engine, I will need to identify methods of importing this properly for web use. How Gaza is emphasized cartographically is important to this project and will be something that I will keep in mind while I design this story map.

In the readme file, please make a table to list all the data sources for your final project. If your final project is in a story map format, please also list the photos, videos, archives, newspapers and any other data you would like to visualize in the map. Regarding each row of data source, it should include the name, description, url link, memo, and etc.; and

Name | Description | URL | Notes
------ | ---- | ------- | ------
Land Cover 2000 - 2015 | These were classified using training data and a random tree classifier.
